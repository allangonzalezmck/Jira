Epic Name: Foundation for Microsegmentation

Epic Description: This epic focuses on establishing the core components and initial testing required for microsegmentation implementation.

Phases included in this Epic:

Macrosegmentation Automation for Testing:

Develop and automate the creation of macrosegmentation within a designated testing tenant.
This will serve as the initial network isolation for subsequent microsegmentation efforts.
NSX Application Appliance Deployment:

Deploy the NSX Application appliance to enable NSX Intelligence functionality within the NSX environment.
This will facilitate the automated generation of microsegmentation rules based on observed network traffic.
Automated Microsegmentation Rule Testing:

Conduct initial tests on the auto-deployment of microsegmentation rules suggested by NSX Intelligence.
Evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of these rules in a controlled environment.
Manual Microsegmentation and Data Requirements:

Implement manual microsegmentation on a low-impact, existing application within a test tenant.
Utilize this process to identify and document the minimum product data information requirements necessary for onboarding PCI-compliant applications.
This information will streamline future microsegmentation efforts for applications with specific compliance needs.
Expected Outcomes:

A functional macrosegmentation framework in a testing environment.
NSX Intelligence enabled for automated rule generation.
Initial insights into the effectiveness of automated microsegmentation rules.
Clearly defined product data requirements for onboarding PCI-compliant applications into a microsegmented environment.
